We are launching a Web3 Social username service called FantomNames.org where anybody could mint their very own web3 domain username with a .fantom extension.

The .fantom extension represents the Fantom community. Once the username is minted it belongs to the user forever (no renewables).

### Strengthening bonds within the Fantom community

Many people are already using .eth names as usernames on Twitter and other social media.

Imagine the same happening for the Fantom community. Having your own domain extension is good for spreading awareness and it also strengthens bonds between members of the community.

### More than just a domain

Web3 names are a digital identity. Fantom members can use domains as usernames when they log into web3 apps. They can also attach additional data to a domain, like a website URL, or a Twitter handle, or email address. Or they can use domains to easily send tokens and NFTs to each other.

The Fantom Names service is built on top of the Punk Domains protocol that is the go-to protocol for many big projects like KlimaDAO, Smol Brains, Layer2DAO and more.

### Many possible integrations

Any dApp or web3 frontend can easily integrate with .fantom domain extensions.

The protocol is completely permissionless and the code is open-sourced on our Github: https://github.com/punk-domains

### Minting fees => Public Goods

We are firm believers in public goods funding.

That is why 50% of the domain minting proceeds will go into funding public goods projects on Fantom.

### The future & conclusion

Web3 Social is arriving in a big way. There are many projects building different parts (lego blocks) of the upcoming Web3 Social.

Usernames (aka “domains”) are one of these building blocks. The whole idea is based on the fact that every user owns their online identity and the content they produce (posts, comments, images, etc.)

Web3 names are the integral part of Web3 Social. They mainly serve as usernames, but can also hold additional (optional) data such as homepage URL, image data, email address, etc.

Let’s bring the Fantom community into the Web3 Social space together!

To use tokens in decentralised applications such as Uniswap you have to grant the application permission to spend tokens on your behalf - known as an allowance. Allowances are an important part of using these apps, but can be dangerous if left unchecked.

Bugs can exists and exploits can happen even in established projects, and by approving token allowances you are potentially exposing your wallet to these exploits. To keep yourself safe from allowance exploits it is a good practice to regularly inspect and revoke your allowances.

Revoke.cash comes in as a preventative tool to manage your token allowances and practice proper wallet hygiene. By regularly revoking active allowances you reduce the chances of becoming the victim of allowance exploits.

In many cases, phishing websites try to make you sign an allowance while they pretend to be an NFT mint or other legitimate use cases. When these phishing scams happen, it is recommended to use Revoke.cash to mitigate the damage, but it is even better to prevent the scam in the first place.

In the 10 months since its founding by UK-based brothers Jimmy and Avery, a group of about a dozen game, smart contract and business developers have come together to build a better model for on-chain gaming. 

Our goal is to build an inclusive decentralized gaming “world” where user participation drives the direction of development and culture. 

We’re using Fantom rails to facilitate near-instant in-game transaction settlement for arena matches, self-custodied user inventories and “faction” armories. 

We’re designing a new v2 tokenomic model and smart contract system - replacing token inflation with platform fees as the driver of in-game incentives’ and healthy ecosystem participation. 

We’re focused on providing the maximum value to users, and building the most kickass gaming community on the blockchain - or anywhere else.

We had a pretty unusual route to “finding ourselves” as a protocol. Last March, we launched a yield optimizer platform called Magik.Farm, intent on generating fees to keep the lights on while the market tanked. 

Our lead game developer Kyle started off as a community member. So did our operations manager Brett. In fact, every member of the Magik team has come from its community (myself included). 

We’ve spent close to $0 on marketing or advertising. We’ve never raised funds/vc or dumped tokens for project runway. We’ve been a net accumulator of MAGIK.

We’re proud of what we’ve done together over the past 10 months - building a team of deep conviction from 0. We humbly ask for your support in helping us take it to the next level.

Our role at Magik.Farm as a service provider allowed us to build deep relationships with numerous protocols on other chains. They’re pitching in to promote and facilitate an in-game starter pack that will get its users a bit of MAGIK and FTM gas. We want to make it easy for anyone to jump in and play.  We’re looking to build multi-layered and meaningful in-game economies within a UX that just works. We want users to ultimately drive and be the beneficiaries of those economies. Our focus is primarily on game development, but long term we see potential for Magik World as a space for social hangouts, subscription based communities and 3rd party vendor storefronts for in-game and out of game assets.  There’s a vast world waiting to be built. We’re making it easy to become a homesteader and cultivate the land.",

Through its wide range of products (Farms, Shadow Farms, Liquid Wrappers and Upcoming Marketplace for incentives) LiquidDriver can drive a deep and sticky liquidity to its partners, while providing optimized yield for its users.  LiquidDriver firepower relies on $LQDR emissions combined with adapted tokenomics that incentivize the long term interests alignment of all its stakeholders. The protocol has been designed to acquire substantial governance power over the emissions of strategic protocols, on any EVM compatible chain.  The long term objective of LiquidDriver is to reduce $LQDR inflation to [10%-15%] annually. In order to achieve that goal, LiquidDriver focuses its effort in the acquisition of governance tokens that will back $LQDR value. Therefore, It is in the interest of LiquidDriver to incentivize a deep liquidity in those protocols, as well as providing products that allow users to extract optimized yield out of those protocols.  As of today, LiquidDriver’s governance power is as follows:  - 36% of SpiritSwap governance power (Solidly-like DEX - Fantom)  - 31% of Hundred Finance governance power (Cross-chain Lending Platform) - 1.2% of THENA’s governance power (Velodrome-like DEX - BNB Chain) - Upcoming investment already voted [1%-1.5%] of Velodrome governance power (DEX - Optimism)","As deployed initially in June 2021, LiquidDriver was a fork of Sushiswap  Since then, LiquidDriver carried out the following improvements: Implementation of the “revenue sharing vault” to which xLQDR holders can access. xLQDR is the locked version of $LQDR based on the veCRV contract from Curve Finance. Implementation of liquid wrappers to accumulate governance power over protocols on Fantom. “linSpirit” liquid wrapper to lock inSpirit from SpiritSwap on the back-end. “liHND” liquid wrapper to lock veHND from Hundred Finance on the back-end. Those contracts are based on the cvxCRV contract from Convex Finance. Implementation of the “Shadow Farms”. Shadow Farms are a cutting-edge type of farm that take an LP token as an input, stake & farm the governance token on the issuing protocol, swap the governance token for its interest-bearing version, stake the interest bearing version and auto-compound the rewards into more interest-bearing version. Unlike a classic auto-compounder, users of Shadow Farms get on average higher rewards and are taking a long position on the interest-bearing version of the token, as opposed to the LP token being autocompounded. (More details in this article : https://liquiddriver.medium.com/shadow-farms-the-ultimate-maximization-layer-of-spiritswap-v2-8bba62e612c) The code base has been audited by Certik and is currently kept under a bug bounty program (Upcoming) Implementation of the Master Gauges. “Master Gauges” is a product that allows $LQDR emissions to be decentralized and allocated on a bi-weekly basis by xLQDR holders and partners protocols on a specific Marketplace.

Impact: Make NPLs accessible to smaller investors via tokens 100% regulated CASP requirements under MiCA.

Market size: European Non-Performing Loans were reported this year at €950 billion

The What: There are many types of NPLs. We work closely with European banks that exit an NPL for a discount of up to 20%. If we detect an opportunity we buy it and work on executing the project so that we recover the ROI at which that loan was granted → the extra 20%.

The How: Instead of providing us with liquidity or big investors, tokenization allows us to have smaller retail investors that can gain high returns on tokens with a real tangible subjacent. This is something only a few have access, we want to democratize this under a regulated framework.

Grant Details:

Encounter is a project that not only attracted 2500 players so far, it also focuses on fun first.

It is highly strategic and competitive, and it isn't  a ""gimmicks-based"" way to earn tokens like most other blockchain games.

What
Trusta provides in-depth insight, analysis and evaluation of Web3 users. Our product scans transactions and addresses in major blockchains, supports the projects in ecosystems with analysis of sybil attack risk, fraud risk and identity value of their users. Trusta aims to bring more transparency to Web3 data, enabling the ecosystem to allocate on-chain assets with the right users, other than sybils or bots.
Trusta just won the first place in Gitcoin Open Data Science Hackathon for Sybil Slayer, our report per below: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/opendata-community-hackathon-results/11943

2. Why
On-chain data is fully open, but also unstructured and explosive, entrepreneurs and teams are badly in need of insights into overall characteristics of their users. Especially many of them attract users using giveaways, airdrops and etc,  informed decision could reduce sybils/bots, and increase quality of their communities.

3. How
Trusta incorporates various modern AI & Graph Mining algorithms and data-driven technologies to bring verifiable on-chain identity.

4. Who

Founders are ex-leaders of Ant Financial (the biggest Fintech company in the world with over 1 billion users)AI and Security Labs and are very experienced with ID verification and fraud prevention with proven records in Ant Financial.",https://www.trustalabs.ai,https://github.com/0x9simon/,,@TrustaLabs,"Yes, angel investors",10 people,Yes,"1. No ready-to-use solution for anti-fraud and sybil prevention in Fantom ecosystem. There are already hundreds of DApps running on Fantom, most of them will need to airdrop their core users. There are Oracles and general data services such as the Graph, Chainlink and etc., but no team covers anti-fraud and sybil prevention sector. Sybils gain tokens with systematic methodologies, they harvest a large number and dump tokens very quickly, causing negative price volatility and taking a toll on the community.  When Fantom community projects are about to airdrop, giveaway or do other promotions, they will need to battle sybils and bots on themselves, and only to find themselves hands tight: few of them would maintain a team of specialized data scientists or developers.  Therefore, Optimism and Gnosis Safe have turned to the community's help for sybil detection, which works to certain extent but was really not efficient. 2. Trusta will serve the unserved and provide unique data services for Fantom Ecosystem.  Trusta founders are top-tier experts in the AI and security area in Web2. Each of them has 10-20 years experience in anti-fraud AI modeling and product development.  The team delivers fast and with high quality in web3 as well. We started Trusta in Octorber 2022,  won the First Place of Gitcoin Opendata Hackathon for sybil slay in Novernmber and will publish a ready-to-use product in December.

Trusta works in multi chains, and would also bring insights regarding users' behavior in other chains and cross Fantom Web3 users are multi-chain users, sybils work across chains as well.

As Fractal Studios grows, there will continue to be new use cases developed, and given its cross-chain capabilities, it is an ideal candidate to expand to supporting other projects’ ecosystems.

We have released a number of products over the course of the past year, including:

TheGenerative.Network which provides permanent, passive income immutably via smart contract. Users purchase generators with the token of their choice (currently DAI, FTM, FUSD, USDC or SPIRIT) which, utilizing an auto-balancing function, will continuously provide the owner daily returns in the token used to make the purchase.


LetsConquer.Earth is a yield earning strategy game based on global domination. With influences from classic board games such as Risk & Settlers of Catan, this game provides users the opportunity to have some fun while earning crypto. Conquer countries, spread your message, create allies, and collect all dropped items to become Grand Champion, granting you a percentage of the rewards pool for as long as you remain the reigning champ.

SAGA, or Stable Aggregation Asset, is a permissionless stable asset vault that allows users to wrap their stablecoin into a new one. This allows users to safely store their assets while also offering a zero cost, no fee way to arbitrage stable assets. This product is provided as a service for everyone and, as such, is free to use and has no hidden fees.

Our flagship digital trading card game, Lexicon: The Chaos of Cantor, is currently in development. Taking inspiration from classic trading card games such as Pokemon & Magic: The Gathering, Lexicon will transport players back to yesteryear and recreate the feelings of anticipation and excitement surrounding traditional trading card games. Whether it’s buying packs, trading cards with friends, building a killer deck, or the gameplay itself, this promises to scratch that childhood itch. The cards feature art from multiple talented artists, including some of the biggest names in Fantom NFTs, and the lore is second to none. Of course, there is a lot more to a card game than the story and art, and you can rest assured that we are making absolutely certain that gameplay is properly balanced. And with multiple rarities and classes, gameplay will be constantly evolving as players create new tactics and strategies.

As you can see, we have been busy, but we still have so many more plans. Help us make those ideas come to fruition sooner by supporting us in our journey to make crypto fun and accessible to all. All of us at Fractal Studios thank you for your consideration.

That will keep Fantom's ecosystem users engaged and educated especially in the BEAR Market.

The grant is mainly used for 3rd party auditioning, building the community, and the development and operation costs before we can be self-sustained.

The project is to create living creatures that are fully built on the chain for relaxing gaming and much more. Fantoman (trainer) & Fantomonstre (creature) token complies with ERC721 standard and 'LifeCycle' (LNFT). It means they have their unique 'Life Cycle' in the contract (the law of life is immutable). The Fantomonstre started with an egg, grew, and evolve based on the training and food given with the transactions from time to time. It will die and resume back to an egg if not taken care of (you can also delegate/loan to another wallet) or get too old. It is a brand new concept that has 'living creatures' in the blockchain. FTM has the speed and very low fee to make this fully on-chain. Spent some time with your Fantomonstre and they will help you to earn $FTM via tournaments and leagues. These will help Fantom Opera to maintain user engagement through the bear market (It is like working at 'McDonald'). Since it is fully written in FTM contracts and stays in the blockchain forever, any project team could cross-collaborate with this project. E.g. Paintswap, 8BIT, etc.

The project is aimed at self-sustaining. The treasury will receive $FTM from the advertisement, social spending in the game, and tickets for events and tournaments and 100% of it will fund the reward for the Fantoman that raises their Fantomonstre and compete or work for the Fantom World (operate like decentralized Google, Facebook/Meta model). The project can be bootstrapped by any sponsors sending funds to the project treasury for the reward. Besides, the game will include an interesting, growing story based on the historical events that happened in Fantom, attracting, guiding, and educating new users about DeFi, risk, safety measures, etc.

I plan to have a fair launch minting and target the 'long tail' of Fantom users (small wallets, or new small investors who hold $FTM in their bags). No ERC20 token has been planned because it is easily been manipulated and is against my target audience. Only $FTM serves as the currency.

Infrastructure Layer
Entangle Oracle Blockchain is an EVM Blockchain specialized for storing, distributing, verifying and validating information created with the Cosmos SDK based upon Ethermint with an addition of EVM Module.  Entangle Oracle Blockchain facilitates Entangled Distributed Oracle Solution to facilitate transactions for all the Entangle applications and developers needing an efficient, secure and cost-effective Oracle Solution.
Entangled Distributed Oracle Solution can help any dApp on any blockchain for the collection, storage, verification and validation of data in order to replicate states cross-chain and automate their smart contracts given their respective event-triggers, giving benefits such as: 
Oracle-Specific Blockchain (Not burdened with other transactions) 
Cheap Gas and Customizable Parameters (Partners can define their own logic and expenses)
User-Friendly for Developers (Write contracts in Solidity)

Developers can launch self-defined Spotter Smart Contracts inside Entangle Blockchain and hire keepers with their custom Oracle Backend Off-Chain Scripts to collect information to be verified, processed and redirected towards their aggregator smart contract connected to their dApp for event triggers and data-upkeep.
Developers can hire as many or few keepers as they need depending on the sensitivity of the data and set their own consensus parameters within the spotter smart contracts.

By virtue of its infrastructure, Entangle is able to simplify access and aggregation of liquidity across different blockchains and to provide secure opportunities for protocols to scale their liquidity cross-chain. Along with routing liquidity cross-chain to protocols, Entangle has built mechanisms which maximize liquidity retention and capital efficiency to incentivize sticky and loyal liquidity in the DeFi Space.

Entangle dApp 1) Cross-Chain Liquidity Aggregation through Synthetic Vaults

One example of Synthetic Vaults are Synthetic LPs mirroring the state of the base LP asset on a different chain. 
Synthetic LPs are minted 1:1 to Physical-LPs and are based on an initial pre-liquidity given by liquidity providers, to be scaled given demand by intricate rebalancing mechanisms whilst avoiding the usage of 3rd party physical bridges.
Users can be exposed to yield cross-chain without ever having to leave their “home” chain through Entangle's Internal Limit Order Book DEXs, by exchanging Synthetic LPs on any chain representing LP positions on any other chain.

Entangle dApp 2) EnUSD - Fully Collateralized Cross-Chain Stablecoin
Users can borrow EnUSD against their Synthetic LP tokens as collateral ensuring both capital efficiency for the users, and sticky liquidity for the protocols which host the underlying physical LP of the Synthetic LP token.

Entangle hosts Liquidation Engines for EnUSD natively on each chain with dynamic LTV parameters, minimizing impacts of black swan events by optimizing liquidation rates real-time based on volatility and underlying asset health.

 Entangle is actively partnering with perps and other derivative protocols to bring further utility to Synthetic LPs. Users can provide Synthetic LPs to perps protocols to achieve an APY% return, whilst protocols can use cross-chain liquidity as a base achieving a higher possibility of scalability.

Entangle aims to act as a universal liquidity layer empowering a truly omnichain future with stronger and more fluid connections between blockchains, allowing more opportunities for users, protocols and chains to emerge.

Impact of Entangle
Any protocol on any chain can further scale by attracting omni-chain liquidity from users it didn’t have access to before - most importantly they can attract efficient and sticky liquidity from any chain as users can borrow EnUSD with yield-bearing assets (Synthetic LPs) as collateral and Synthetic LPs can be recycled into derivative protocols.


Through Synthetic Vaults users are able to provide liquidity from any chain to for example FTM in one-click without having to bridge assets, administering multiple wallets and going through multiple steps and transactions, helping FTM to attract liquidity from chains it previously could not and ultimately a larger user base in an easy and intuitive way for the end-user.

Given demand, Entangle can scale the initial liquidity deposited on FTM without relying on 3rd party external bridges in most circumstances through its “Soft Rebalancing” mechanism, achieving seamless accessibility for any user on any chain within the Entangle Framework.

Furthermore, Entangle users can provide their Synthetic LPs (based on underlying liquidity provided to FTM) to derivative protocols such as Rage Trade to be used as base liquidity for their perps strategies.
This enables users to earn additional revenue on top of being exposed to yield by providing liquidity to FTM, indirectly incentivizing them to stay invested, achieving sticky and loyal liquidity for FTM.

A real applicable process example:
(2 types of Entangle users; Liquidity Providers and Normal Users)
→ example with Spookyswap on FTM

Liquidity Providers lock their USDC within Entangle for 3, 6 or 12 Months, by choosing either a Stable Vault or a Mixed Vault
On the basis of USDC locked and which type of Vault, Entangle will get LP Tokens on Spookyswap by providing Liquidity, and accordingly mint Synthetic LPs on each chain's Internal DEXes, divided equally within the Entangle Framework
Entangle autocompounds the LP tokens, and as these rise in amount and price, Entangle's Oracles relay this information to other chains Internal DEXs for users to realize the yield on their Synthetic LP Tokens


Normal Users have USDC in a wallet on any network of choice within the Entangle Framework
Users select a pool (Synth-Vault) they would like to be exposed to (e.g.FTM/USDC), by depositing USDC in exchange for Synthetic LPs
Given enough demand and an overflow of USDC in that Internal DEX, a rebalancing event is triggered for scaling purposes, where there is more USDC deposited into the underlying LP on Spookyswap, and more Synthetic LPs minted on other chains.
Users have now a yield-bearing Synthetic LP, which can be used for:
     
4a) Depositing the Synthetic LP as collateral to Borrow EnUSD, capped at a certain LTV decided by Entangle's Volatility Indicator, the users can use it on any chain within the Entangle Framework for many utilities, like utilizing the accrued governance powers by holding EnUSD in the Entangle DAO. As a plus, borrowing EnUSD through Synthetic LPs means that FTM can full-fledged act as a backing for EnUSD, therefore FTM would get more utility through Entangle.

4b) Earning more yield by recycling this liquidity into derivatives protocols

Project description: Rather than build something that only benefits our holders and ecosystem. Pluto Pawn was created to bring utility to all NFT’s and Tokens. Fantom NFT collectors will be able to get loans in their favorite tokens, backed by a single or multiple NFTs. Holders of Umans, Magicats, or Cyber Nekos will be able to get loans in $TOMB, $BOO, $BRUSH and more. Our bundle module let’s non-blue chip NFTs in on the fun as well, bundle multiples to get a single loan. Our Peer-to-Peer Marketplace allows users to be borrowers or lenders. Lenders receive a Pawn Ticket NFT, similar to an LP token, making their loans tradable on secondary markets.

Competitors, peers, or similar projects: There are none on the Fantom Network to our knowledge. Similar projects exist on other chains like BendDao which only supports blue-chip NFTs via a pool. NFTfi, only supports $WETH and $DAI tokens on mainnet. JPEG’d only provides loans in their native $pUSD token.



Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes, once deployed. We can grant judges access to private repositories to confirm.



Date of deployment: The smart contracts are ready now, and have passed internal testing and audits. In order to ensure the community that our contracts are safe to interact with, we seek to raise funds to pay for a 3rd party audit through Sherlock or Code4Arena. During this stage we can also show progress made on the front-end design, and will be projected to start on the front-end following their completion. Preview our last test on Goerli testnet: 



Has your project previously applied for a grant? No, this is our first time applying for any grant.



Proof of Progress: We deployed a test loan on Goerli, that can be seen here: https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/goerli/0xfafa88920e1275f7231e969a8751196c13d83ad4/0 



We are also sharing some of our progress on the dApp design, this is still a work and progress and the final product could be different.

Thriving towards been the most technologically advanced NFT marketplace in existence on any network.,https://paintswap.finance/,,,paint_swap,No,8,No,"PaintSwap – NFT Marketplace Cutting Edge Development for the Decentralized World  Establishing a platform on Fantom in the Spring of 2021, the original five founders of PaintSwap shared a vision of bringing decentralized performance and technology to the forefront of the dApp market through superior solidity and high UX standards. In the year and a half plus of its existence, PaintSwap has risen to become the leading NFT marketplace on Fantom Opera and is now ready to expand, creating a fully realized project on that same ecosystem. This proposal will detail some of the unique features that PaintSwap is ready to bring to the already vibrant community of Fantom Opera. Everything that will follow has been done without any outside financial support. Imagine what we could do with funding. Continued Pioneering through Constant Commitment The focus of dApps residing on Fantom Opera at this time should be the attraction and retention of outside, unaccounted-for capital. To this end, PaintSwap released an ambitious road map highlighting the features that we will implement to attract new users into our ecosystem while serving and maintaining users already present. A few of these upcoming features will be listed and expanded upon below. fNFT Marketplace The next wave of technology in our sector could well involve financial NFTs and the security offered by them. PaintSwap is determined to make Fantom Opera a cornerstone of this major opportunity. We are already well on the way to making a secondary platform tied to the main PaintSwap marketplace that is dedicated to trades, sales, and interactions with fNFTs.  Cross-chain Marketplace and Contract Factory Our success in attracting and supporting over 1300 NFT collections on Fantom Opera demonstrates that there is a hunger for reliable, decentralized support of NFT collections throughout the crypto community. This hunger, however, has recently been impacted by an imbalance of creation versus liquidity in various ecosystems. PaintSwap intends to return vitality to the Fantom NFT community by introducing the many incredible creators and builders on our marketplace to other chains. This will result in the cross-pollination of liquidity pools, introducing new users to all chains and projects involved. Global NFT Tracking with Option to Hide Rather than leaping into the implementation of our Track-All subgraph, PaintSwap has chosen to take a more measured approach to increase user control and decrease the potential for malevolence. We will implement an advanced, customizable interface to hide content from contracts on a user-level basis, along with certain larger-scale controls to allow the concealment of known malicious contracts.  Building Creative Solutions PaintSwap’s NFT marketplace is a built-from-scratch solution based on the needs that were present in the Fantom community at the time of conception. Since that time, the team has continued to expand upon the foundation of proactive measures addressing the opportunities of the future. In fact, several of the implementations that have been introduced are uniquely available on PaintSwap, even when considering readily available markets on other chains. Bulk Actions PaintSwap brought brand new technology to the Fantom Opera scene with the implementation of our various Bulk Actions. Simplifying processes for Buyers, Sellers, and Project Managers using revolutionary, gas-conscious construction that makes the site and its Solidity scalable to support massive volume. Bulk Listing, Transferring, Offering, Burning, and more are all available as single transaction events on the PaintSwap platform, saving time and money for all involved.  Customizable Statistics With the release of v3 of the marketplace came our advanced statistics interface, which allows the user to customise displayed metrics and time frames on a global or collection level. This provides invaluable buying insight for all purchasers, regardless of what metrics they observe when doing their own research on projects. This, in conjunction with our BubbleMaps partnership, creates a level playing field of unfiltered information on which all users of the platform can engage responsibly with new and existing products. On top of that, Project Managers (or even active community members) can both generate a social media-ready postcard of collection statistics and embed a live iFrame of collection stats on websites. These features are publicly visible and available to all, maintaining our standard of easily accessible, decentralised information. ERC 2981 (Native Royalty) Support PaintSwap has always enforced creator-designated royalties on sales. Our stance on this matter is very clear. We do this both through our UI (for collections without the native contract standard) and through enforcement of the ERC 2981 Solidity standard. In order to assuage any concerns about malevolent collections imposing outrageous royalty percentages to discourage selling or profiteer from user ignorance, PaintSwap caps royalties at 7.5%. This, along with our marketplace sale fee of 2.5% make the maximum liability for a seller 10%. This is nothing new. PaintSwap has maintained these standards long before it entered the zeitgeist; in fact, this has been our policy since the inception of the marketplace.      Maintaining Expected Standards Rather than spending any more valuable time digging into the minutia of certain items, the following will be a list of the many standards upheld by PaintSwap. Many of these are found nowhere else on Fantom Opera, and some are rarely found on any chain.

8BIT Metaverse’s vision is to create a fun and engaging interoperable metaverse that can perform multiple DeFi transactions including a multiple P2E gaming system while giving users a platform where they can integrate or build communities.

What have we built so far?

Since our launch in November 2021, we have built the largest pixel metaverse on blockchain complete with unique environment and character designs.

We have also built an inventory system that allows a user to trade NFT wearables and use them on the blockchain. 

Lastly, we have integrated multiple Dapps in the $FTM ecosystem and other networks that are fully interoperable within the 8BIT Metaverse. This year alone, we have partnered with more than 40+ NFT and DeFi projects including Dapp Radar and Clover wallet. 

Where would we use the grant?

Although we are confident that we are able to produce the whole P2E game and provide additional functionalities within the metaverse with the funds that we have raised from our Netizen sales last year, any additional funding will help us achieve our main goal - which is to attract more players and communities 

The grant will be used to:

1. Fund research on 8BIT Acedemy (8BIT learn) a pixel game that will help educate users on GameFi, token farming, DeFi, and most importantly blockchain security! Think of it as a gamified education system. 

2. Form an aggressive WEB3 marketing and partnership team that will stay up-to-date with the current NFT trends and maintain good relationships with other NFT communities cross chain.

3. Hire senior game developers who can work on additional P2E games.

4. Marketing fund for twitch and NFT gaming influencers.

Proof Of Knowledge

We will educate our community about the importance of our work in cleanup, conservation, and regeneration of our local ocean ecosystem. We will also provide web3 learning opportunities to our community. We've partnered with Lirn.io and Cryptoversidad to provide educational web3 courses that range from essential onboarding, like wallet creation, to advanced web3 business development and solidity. We hope this will create a pay-it-forward mindset that will encourage more Hondurans to buidl public goods projects using web3.

We are an innovative Web3 solutions company passionate about decentralization and making a level playing ground for every participant in crypto by creating unbiased systems that distribute wealth in a fair system.
What is Bulletproof Productions mission?

Bulletproof Productions mission statement is simple “Turning cents into Dollars 💰’ for Artists with Killer Beats.”. We give the power back in the hands of the artist and the fans so they both benefit from creating and enjoying the music they love.
How does Bulletproof Productions achieve its mission?

Bulletproof Productions is built for artists and fans first. Unlike the current content distribution systems, Intellectual Property management systems and royalty payment systems, where all capture value from the Artists creation and fail to pass it back to the original creator.

Let's break it down!

The current Content Distribution system is flawed in many ways, but one of the most important failures that directly impacts the artist is: it favors content distributors over talented content creators. The distributors of content end up getting most of the returns generated by the artist's content. Bulletproof Productions utilizing blockchain technology with Audio NFTs running on our specially designed Decentralized Content Distribution System allows artists to publish and share directly with their fans, who pay cryptocurrencies to support the artist and enjoy their creations. The artist gets the funds directly from the fans and the fans directly support the artist. This is where Bulletproof Productions puts the artist and fans in direct contact to create this mutually beneficial relationship. In the future, content consumers (fans) won’t be paying a subscription fee to platforms and will directly give to content creators (Artists) they love & support. Bulletproof Productions brings the future to now with its current Decentralized Content Distribution System.

Current Intellectual Property management systems and copyright law protects the artists / creators work, although they need a definitive registration system to prove ownership. With current distribution systems and the amount of data on the internet anyone can download and use your creation and it will be nearly impossible to track down every use. Even if you do find every individual use, you then need to pay legal fees for every copyright breach, which will most probably outweigh any financial gain. Enter Bulletproof Productions Audio NFTs with a blockchain transaction and timestamp, usage tracking, digital audio watermark copyright protection all living on a distributed ledger that guards your Intellectual Property by making each piece of content uniquely addressable.

The above ways in which Bulletproof Productions solves the current Content Distribution and Intellectual Property problems allows the Artist / Creator to gain max benefits from Royalties. The Artist doesn’t need a middleman or to wait for their royalties to be calculated, skimmed, deducted before they get their cut. The Artist can view, verify and claim their royalties in real time, instantly!
But what about the fans …

Fans also suffer paying for content they don’t even listen to or enjoy. Furthermore, they don’t get to contribute directly to the success of their favorite artist or be a part of their upcoming. They have no way of proving they were there from the beginning before the Artist became a multi-platinum record selling star. There is no direct relationship between the Artist and the diehard fans. Hold on… now there is! With Bulletproof Productions a fan can personalize a track by recording onto an existing track from the artist and own that unique copy, at the same time the artist receives Royalties because the fan used the artist’s track. Now the fan can also get royalties if anyone uses the fan’s unique copy!
Raise funds on Bulletproof Productions

Anyone can use the Bulletproof Productions’ website to raise funds just by recording or uploading any audio content they create.

For example, you would like to raise funds for the local sports club you are a member of, a school, a hospital, a friend in need, a project or anything that you think deserves financial assistance. You record or upload onsite an audio message from yourself, your local sports clubs theme song, a poem, details about a project or anything you deem relevant to the cause. In return you get a playable link to share your newly created Audio NFT on any platform for others to donate their support by minting a unique copy of your Audio NFT.

To check how much money you have raised go to the Royalties page to see how much you have raised so far.
",https://bulletproof.ltd,BulletproofProductions,,BulletProds,No,2,No,"The protocol solves the problems of the current music/audio content distribution, intellectual property and royalty payments trilemma.  This first of its kind implementation of anyone being able to upload their audio creations and earn instantly from them with copyright protection, distribution channels and transparent royalty management. will bring new artists / creators and their fan base to Fantom.  The social sharing of the created audio NFT from  within the platform allows  fundraising for communities and artists which will also utilize the Fantom ecosystem and bring their communities onto Fantom.",

Providing a one-stop solution for seamless usability of DeFi, NFTs and easy cross-border payments, with a gateway to the world of Web3/DApps directly within the wallet’s Web3 browser (first ever on desktop). Fulfilling all a user's needs, while removing the complexities of decentralized finance and enabling economic freedom for everyone globally!

From day one, we have focused on enhancing and providing the best possible user experience and lowering the barrier to entry, to allow for streamlined and secure adoption of DeFi and Web3. Providing a world-class user experience with a seamless user interface, and a full spectrum of constantly growing features and services as a one-stop hub, delivering a more curated in-wallet experience. Making Infinity Wallet the complete solution for all crypto users’ needs, while making adoption and usage of cross-border payments, DeFi, NFTs and Web3 easier than ever before.

Infinity Wallet is also the first desktop platform to provide users with access to the entire Web3 and DApp space without needing to leave their wallet, with the first Web3 browser and Web3/DApp store directly within the platform (https://docs.infinitywallet.io/infinity-wallet/features-and-notable-advancements/browser-less-dapps-and-web3). Finally removing the need to ever use unintuitive browser extension wallets again! Providing a far superior, safer and more natural user experience, with a range of unique advantages/benefits for users, DApps and chains alike, while enabling easier use and adoption.

The problem today is that while wallets are the most fundamental component required for usage and adoption of DeFi, Web3, crypto payments, a chain and its ecosystem, they are one of the least well developed applications in the crypto ecosystem. Wallets currently act mainly as an interface, serving primarily as a transaction signing layer, with very limited functionality or direct features/services/protocols (users generally have to search, find, learn and interact with many different applications and services), and are generally lacking in basic UX, while providing very unprofessional, hard to use and aesthetically poor user interfaces. This has been sufficient for the early adopters in crypto, however, for the next billion users to onboard to DeFi and Web3, a more curated and high quality user experience is required.

Infinity Wallet steps in to fill this need, as a one-stop hub for all payment, DeFi, NFT and Web3 activity. Providing a unique all-in-one wallet solution with a full spectrum of services, features and protocols in a premium platform, with a focus on delivering a seamless decentralized user experience and a user centric interface. Streamlining accessibility and lowering the barrier to entry, to allow for true adoption of DeFi, crypto payments & Web 3.0 globally.

Infinity Wallet will benefit the Fantom ecosystem and holders by providing a unique all-in-one wallet & ecosystem solution on desktop (with mobile to come in the future), with a focus on premium quality. Delivering a seamless user experience and a user-centric interface, along with access to current and a wide range of constantly growing features/services. Providing Fantom access to the many advancements we have, bringing much needed value (infrastructure, features/services and a premium quality platform) to Fantom .

Infinity Wallet will allow Fantom ecosystem to be more easily adopted and used by the general public, in a unique crypto wallet, payment solution and Web3/DApp browser built for the masses, and used already by hundreds of thousands of users worldwide for easy cross-border payments, access to DeFi, NFTs and interacting with Web3/DApps directly within their wallet. As a one-stop platform for all users to directly access all their DeFi, Web3 and crypto needs, making adoption of the Fantom and its ecosystem as easy and intuitive as possible and boosting awareness, usage and utility.

As decentralized organizations grow in size, it becomes difficult to involve the community in determining what contributions to value. Praise encourages communities to cultivate a culture of giving and gratitude by recognizing and rewarding contributions.

By listening to what the community values and involving members every step of the way, praise allows bottom-up value systems to emerge. This bottom-up approach to value creation is essential for ensuring that the community remains invested and engaged.

Praise is used to recognize the full range of value created, from minor to major contributions. Contributions made outside of any platform can also be recognized. This promotes a more positive and productive community as a whole.",https://givepraise.xyz/,https://github.com/kristoferlund,https://github.com/givepraise/praise,https://twitter.com/givepraise,Gitcoin and General Magic,7,"Praise is about projects installing it, it can be deploy on any chain","Any DAO can use the Praise tool, which is open source to make a reputation system inside the DAO and give governance not only to stakeholders but also to builders",

It helps traders maximize profits and yield at the same time, hence improving capital efficiency as compared to the existing DEXes.

- Symphony DEX optimizes yield on trades by integrating with protocols like Aave, Compound, Yearn, etc. 

- Apart from yield generation, Symphony DEX has other great features like “Liquidity Aggregation”, which benefits the users by executing their trades at the best price. 

- The Stop-loss order type is also supported by Symphony DEX. It is another useful feature that helps with hedging, buying dip, DCAing, etc.

- Anyone can run an executor service & host UI to execute trades. The executor will be incentivized to host their own UI too, which makes Symphony DEX UI decentralized. This would ultimately help eliminate UI downtime.",https://symphony.finance,symphonyfi,symphony-finance,SymphonyFinance,No,6,Yes,"At Symphony, we understand that when you’re riding the volatility, your trades need to execute quickly. This is why we’ve built our DEX as the composability layer that aggregates liquidity across the network, giving the user quick trade execution. Symphony acts as a Meta DEX aggregator, giving the user the best price across all decentralized exchanges and aggregators. A small price change can make a big difference, especially as trading is a matter of fine margins.  We’ve automated yield generation so users can focus on trading. The trades keep earning yield on safe protocols until the time they execute. All one needs to do is create an order, and the yield comes automatically.  Symphony also provides depeg protection by providing a stop-loss order feature. If a token depegs, your stop loss will hit, and you will get out in time with no yield wasted. This will safeguard users from situations like the UST catastrophe.  All in all, Symphony DEX provides a win-win situation for its users, while they maintain self-custody of their assets on Fantom.",

The more you engage with WigoSwap, the more you contribute to the scalability and stability of the protocol.

WigoSwap’s comprehensive Web3 platform provides DeFi services including DEX, Yield Farming, and Staking, with the lowest transaction fees in the Fantom ecosystem (only 0.19%).

A clean and responsive user interface means that DeFi Degens and crypto newbies can quickly familiarize themselves with the WigoSwap protocol and feel completely at home.

Alongside WigoSwap’s standard DeFi offerings, exclusive products like WigoGalaxy and PREDICT inject fun and bring even more earnings opportunities to the seamless Web3 experience we provide.

One of WigoSwap’s many advantages is that as engagement and numbers of users increase, the unique Gamified Burning Mechanism or GBM removes tokens from the circulating supply to extend the emissions distribution period without exceeding the 2B token hard cap.

We try to do things differently on WigoSwap, and we sum up the protocol with this one sentence: WigoSwap enables you to trade your tokens efficiently, earn passive income, and have fun in DeFi. 

The WigoSwap team includes experts and enthusiasts who have been believers in Fantom for years. 

We know that for a network to succeed, it needs to attract users via innovative, scalable technology and practical applications that showcase the network’s capabilities. 

Powerful and groundbreaking DeFi protocols have been developed on Fantom, but due to a lack of attention to user experience and usability, these complex platforms have been unable to attract inexperienced users. 

WigoSwap fills this gap with a  DeFi platform combining sophisticated tools and a carefully designed, pleasing visual interface. 

From the outset, our aim has been to build an easy- and enjoyable-to-use DeFi protocol that leverages the capabilities of the Fantom network and lowers the barriers to entry that limit new users.

Several key factors sustain our competitive advantage:

- Simplicity and comprehensibility:
We think user-centric, create simple solutions for real problems, and avoid complicated terms and over-specialized solutions. DeFi should be the answer to users’ problems and not the cause of more problems.
Belief in effective simplicity guides our products, the user interface, and the documentation we produce.

- DeFi with GameFi:
We inject an element of fun into DeFi through WigoGalaxy rich user profiles and mini-games. WigoGalaxy opens a new world of gamification in DeFi.

- Sustainability and scalability:
WigoSwap’s tokenomics and deflationary mechanisms are designed around sustainability. A hard cap of 2B limits the total circulating supply. Through the Gameified Burning Mechanism, a significant portion of the WIGO is removed from circulation and reallocated to emissions rewards.
Long-term, with sufficient user engagement, it’s possible that WIGO will be deflationary!

- The lowest possible transaction fees:
Transaction fees on WigoSwap are only 0.19%!

- Art and NFT:
The WigoSwap team is connected to a network of artists with whom we are collaborating to build an NFT marketplace (WigoMarket) focused on high-quality collections. Users on the platform can already mint a unique and exclusive NFT Wiggy character usable as a PFP.
More Wiggy-themed collections are on the way as we lead up to the launch of our marketplace!

As a new project born in the bear market, we spend our resources optimally on things that can have more impact and bring more users to WigoSwap:

1- We plan to focus increasingly on GameFi. Our recent investment in the excellent game RedWest marks a vital step in this direction. We believe that GameFi can play a critical role in growing DeFi services.

2- Another key component in our GameFi strategy is WigoGalaxy, an area of WigoSwap where we will continue to develop and offer fun and profitable mini-games that will serve as a portal for users to experience gamified-DeFi.

3- We will grow the Fantom NFT ecosystem with Wiggy NFTs, the NFT Marketplace, and collaborations with reputable artists.

4- In addition to the above, we will soon release the WigoSwap Launchpad and WigoRun, through which blockchain startups can access accelerator and fundraising programs and resources to support their expansion on the Fantom network.

5- WigoSwap's $FTM Liquid Staking will come in Q1 2023!

A great option for $FTM stakers who are looking for another avenue to put the value of their stake to work.

$wiFTM maximizes your rewards, frees up the value of your staked $FTM & increases security of the Fantom network.

The game board pays homage to the FTM community because all properties and game pieces are protocols and NFT projects from the chain's most recognizable builders.

Many consider GameFi to be the hook that will onboard millions to web3 and blockchain entertainment. This is a very likely outcome; however, many games worth playing have a considerable learning curve and the time investment needed to acquire an edge can be exhausting. Being mindful of that, I hope to create a game that requires no such experience -- because the chances are high that any given person already knows how to play ""Monopoly."" In this way, it aims to be a gentle way to lure newcomers to Fantom by giving them a game they already understand.

Spiritopoly also serves to educate those players about our ""spooky"" ecosystem, because the properties and game pieces should encourage them to want to know more about their origins. Thus, it'll be a symbol of the tight-knit creative family that has been forged over the last year.

The game is being built with Unreal Engine 5, and as such, the graphics are being designed with the highest quality in mind. An initial NFT mint was launched with the goal of raising funds to subsidize the cost of game development. Much of the art has been completed because of that, but now additional funds are needed to hire an experienced Unreal developer, who will help bring the functionality of the game to life.

Milestones *
Our 1st milestone is to develop a smart contract catalog for the Fantom blockchain. With our expertise in developing and deploying smart contracts across different blockchains, we can customize the catalog to Fantom’s standards and allow the users to freely pick and choose from 
Our 2nd milestone is to create a smart contract builder to let users customize their smart contracts (in both a no-code and code-friendly fashion) and connect the catalog to Tenzing smart contract deployer with bank-grade security measures in place 
Our 3rd milestone is to integrate the smart contract templates supported in the catalog into Tenzing smart contract manager to enable users to perform transactions like minting, transferring, and burning NFTs without writing a single line of code. In addition, we will set up an event listener system for the Fantom blockchain to collect events from the chain and store them in our database 
The 4th milestone consists of setting up private key management and access control systems compatible with the Fantom network 
The 5th milestone consists of connecting Anchain’s Oracle (https://anchain.ai/blog/chainlinkaml/) for AML (anti-money laundering) checks to Tenzing so we can provide on-chain AML support via smart-contract connectivity on the Fantom blockchain 
The 6th milestone is to release Tenzing to the Fantom ecosystem

Modefi has been created from scratch to give developers multiple options to integrate the ecosystem into their application to support their business model. Data requests can be configured and requested directly from application smart contracts, or they can utilize the smart configuration wizard to request data from off-chain. In either case, the validator network will produce a value verified via the consensus mechanism, and the application contracts need only read it when ready.

Modefi specializes in user-made data requests that do not require the use of an API or specific data formatting. All data requests are human-verified via a consensus mechanism that is customizable based on the level of security the creator deems necessary. 

Users can request any type of data, including strings and numeric types such as integers, decimals, and fractions. A dataset can also be either a single value or list for greatly-improved flexibility, opening up options that do not currently exist in the market, while keeping the process code-free and executed in under 5 minutes.

Currently, the Oracle ecosystems across crypto are either a price feed or a Yes-or-No system. Modefi will change this to allow any and all information to enter the DeFi space and open up an entirely different world of DeFi data access. Supporting prediction markets, real estate, gambling, tournaments, insurance and more, the possibilities for use of the Modefi Oracle system are virtually endless.",https://modefi.io,,Modefi,Modefi_Official,Trustswap,16,Fantom Testnet (Product beta) / Ethereum (Main token),Modefi is a decentralized Oracle suite made to offer customizable aggregation and on-demand oracle solutions to DeFi ecosystems.,
